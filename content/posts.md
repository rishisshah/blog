### Hello World! - March 22, 2020
My life has come to this I guess; scrolling through Zoom/quarantine memes, [watching Michael Reeves scream at his microwave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE39KdptM40&t), and yelling at my own laptop wondering why it won't render my code.

These past two weeks have been a double-edged sword for me. While classes and finals were cancelled, all Los Angeles/Orange County gyms are shut down and a long-planned, out-of-state, vacation is down the drain. Sitting at home and reading through the circle-jerking cesspool that is [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions), - where apprarently everyone is a Standford PhD with 4 internships at FAANG companies - I got motivated and decided to pursue another personal project to keep myself busy and learn something along the way. 

Despite some obstacles, I'm super happy to have created something I can call my own. There's countless avenues I can explore and countless more things to learn. Maybe quarantine won't be so bad after all?
