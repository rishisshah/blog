Welcome to my site! 

I'm a 21 year-old tech enthusiast and senior at UCI, where I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering. While this site is primarily a utility for me to learn about DevOps culture and toolsets, I'll make occasional posts about lifting, learning, coding, working, and other things I do to keep myself busy.

In my free time, I love listening to different genres of music, reading, browsing Reddit, and hiting the gym. 

I hate anime.
